# 🎓 NeuralAcademy
### *Where Theory Meets Code*

**NeuralAcademy** is an AI-powered learning management platform that transforms static study notes into dynamic, interactive learning experiences. Unlike traditional study tools, NeuralAcademy bridges the gap between conceptual reading and practical application by generating custom coding assignments directly from your uploaded materials.

## 🚀 Key Differentiators
*   **AI-Generated Study Sheets:** Automatically extracts core concepts, main ideas, and real-world examples from any PDF.
*   **Integrated Coding Playground:** A built-in sandbox (Monaco Editor) that creates and evaluates code assignments tailored to your specific notes.
*   **"Ask Sage" AI Tutor:** A supportive feedback loop that provides progressive hints and logical guidance rather than just answers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (ES6+).
*   **Backend:** Python ([FastAPI](fastapi.tiangolo.com)).
*   **Machine Learning:** PyMuPDF (Extraction), LangChain, and OpenAI GPT-4o.
*   **Sandbox:** Secure code execution via E2B or Docker containers.

## 📅 Roadmap (Target: Jan 22, 2026)
- [x] Phase 1: Foundation (PDF Text Extraction & Dashboard)
- [ ] Phase 2: The "Brain" (AI Study Guide Generation)
- [ ] Phase 3: The "Evaluator" (Secure Sandbox & AI Tutoring)
